#Final Project Ideas
1. Quacker:

Quacker is a twitter filter application that allows social media managers and customer service representatives to
quickly search twitter for negative tweets pertaining to their brand. According to a 2013 survey done by Dimensional Research Corp, 90 percent of consumers who read online reviews claim that a positive review influenced their purchasing decision.

As a social media or customer service manager, you should be able to log into your Quacker account, apply the negative opinion filter and receive all mentions of your brand that contain negative words. This allows our client to spend time responding to reviews that could potentially affect the opinions of others who read them.

As a user, you will see your account page with a profile photo, and a company title. Underneath this info, they will see a list of filters that can be applied. For the sake of time, only a filter titled, "Quacks" will be available for selection. This filter will only show tweets of those who are "Quacking" about their product or service. Quacking is a term associated with negative opinions.

Once the filter is selected, the user will then select the second tab titled "Feed". This feed will only contain tweets associated with their selected filter, in this case, only negative tweets will be shown. All negative words will be highlighted as to immediatley show the user how this consumer is feeling.

One large button titled "reply" will be showcased underneath the tweet to provide a simple transition for the user to respond appropriatley.

Quacker is not the only twitter filter out on the market today. There are several highly popular applications out there, such as "Mentions" and "HootSuite". Quacker hopes to differentiate itself by providing these filtering services for free with a limited number of responses per week. This will cater towards the small starts-ups who desire a way to effectively protect their image without breaking the bank.

Quacker will be a fun, somewhat passive aggressive application, with bright, clean color schemes and a logo resembling a duck.

Priority: Tweet filter, Reply Abilities
Impact: Simple/Clean Interface, recent tweets are filtered quickly, low lag times.
Mystery: Profile creation, log-in validation, profile photo.

2. The Roamin App:

83 percent of Americans identify as Christian. There are two things Christians do a lot of, they go to church and they travel, as do all Americans. The Roamin app are for all Christians roaming about the country and still desire to attend mass or service on Sundays. Many times when traveling on business I found myself struggling to find the nearest church. Apps I have found with this goal have been very outdated and posses a poor user-experience.You know what they say,  "When in Roam (Rome), find a church."

In the future, this app could be used for all religions and faiths, for the sake of time, I will be focusing on the christian religion.

As a user, you will be allowed to do one thing on this application. Enter your zip code and the rest is done for you. There is no profile/account set-up. You simply open the app, enter location and a list of surrounding churches will appear. Select a church and you will see a dropdown of service/event times. An address will also be available with a google map plug-in to aid in your direction needs. A phone number will also be provided.

In the future, I think it would add benefit to the user to have an uber link for those who do not have a car. It would also be appropiate to one day have Roamin sponsor christian events or concerts with profits going towards building new churches across the globe.

Priority: Church info database, text input field for zip code, phone number and address, clean/modern design  
Impact: Google Maps plug-in, geolocation capabilities without the user entering anything in manually
Mystery: finding a database for churches in the US, linking to uber.
